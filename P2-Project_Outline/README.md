# Project Outline

## Overview

My project PetzWorld, is a lightweight application that gives resources to find pets available in a shelter and details about the pet to people. Its intended eventual use is to connect people who are looking to adopt shelter pets who need a loving and caring forever family.

This project was motivated by the need of a nonprofit organization that wants to unite shelter pets with their forever families.

## Features

- User login: Users will be able to log in, either by creating accounts in the system, or by using a third-party authentication provider (e.g. Google Authentication). All access to the site will be restricted to logged-in users.
- User could search for a pet they are looking for.
- User could mark their favourite pet.
- New pets could be added in the database.

## Technologies

- Language - C#, Javascript
- Markup languages - HTML, CSS
- Framework - ASP.NET Core MVC

- Database engine - mySQL

## What I'll Have to Learn

For the login functionality, I'll have to learn something new in either scenario. If I choose to use native login functionality for the site, I'll need to learn how to use the login approach. If I choose to use third-party authentication, I'll need to learn how to use an OAuth2 provider such as Google Authentication.

I'll also be using test-driven development, writing tests for my code before writing the code itself, so I'll have to learn how to use its testing capabilities.
